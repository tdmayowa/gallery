Simple photo gallery built with nodeJS

### Mux-Media Gallery 

Mux-Media Gallery is a project I tooks wheels of because of a good friend of mine which happens to be photograher. He needed somewhere he could store his pictures and at the same time show the world his craft. So..... '-_-'
I'd like to shine more light on how  images are being uploaded. Images are uploaded via links(which will be updated to file soon). And to upload an image link you have to be logged in using a secret route that only the admin and the key user knows and probably everyone going through my code(this is just a demo version and i am not officiating this exact code to my client). And to be logged in you have to be a registered user using a secret route...
The code is not yet where it ought to be yet but it is a work in progress and i will really appreciate advices on additions and subtractions that should be made.

The front end technologies i summoned '-_-' are : HTML for the markups, CSS for my styling and bootstrap for responsiveness, FancyBox for the gallery that can take images of any size, and vanilla js and jQuery for some functionalities in my contact page.
I used nodeJs(express), and mongoDB for my backend and database respecively
Packages needed to run locally are included in the package.json file.
